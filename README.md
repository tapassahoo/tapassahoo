## âš¡ [Get a Bib Entry from a DOI](https://nhigham.com/category/latex/)
- [x] If you have a paper that has a DOI and wish to obtain a bib entry you can type the DOI into [doi2bib](https://www.doi2bib.org) or [DOI to BibTeX converter](https://www.bibtex.com/c/doi-to-bibtex-converter/). I use [doi2bib](https://www.doi2bib.org) rather than download bib entries from publisher websites, as I find the results are more reliable.
