### Hi there 👋

## My research interests are given below: 

- [x] Quantum molecular dynamics of many–body systems, mathematical modelling, algorithmic developments and high performance computing simulations of complex molecular systems.  
- [x] Estimation of thermodynamic as well as ground state properties of many–body systems by em- ploying Path Integral Monte Carlo methodology.
- [x] Theoretical development of atom–surface scattering by classical and semi-classical perturbation theories.
- [ ] Electronic structure calculations of bio-molecules.
