## ⚡ About Me    
In 2006, I graduated with a Bachelor of Science degree in Chemistry (Hons) from Ramakrishna Mission Vivekananda Centenary College, Rahara, affiliated to the University of Calcutta. After that, I completed my Master of Science degree in Physical Chemistry in 2008 from Rajabazar Science College under the same university. The same year, I started my Ph.D. in Theoretical and Computational Chemistry at the Indian Association for the Cultivation of Science, Kolkata, and received the degree on January 15, 2015, from the University of Calcutta. My thesis title was **Surface temperature effect on the molecule-surface scattering processes and reactive scattering for the triatomic system**. Presently, I am working as a **Post Doctoral Research Associate-III** at **S N Bose National Centre for Basic Sciences**, Kolkata. My research focuses on quantum molecular dynamics, mathematical modeling, algorithmic developments, and high-performance computing simulations of complex molecular systems.
