## âš¡ About Me    
_I completed my B.Sc. degree in Chemistry (Hons) at the University of Calcutta in 2006 and obtained my M.Sc. degree in Chemistry (Physical) from the same university in 2008. Also, I achieved my Ph.D. degree in Chemistry (Physical) from the Indian Association for the Cultivation of Science, Kolkata, in 2015. My thesis title is 'Surface temperature effect on the molecule-surface scattering processes and reactive scattering for the triatomic system.' Currently, I am working as a Post Doctoral Research Associate-III at S N Bose National Centre for Basic Sciences, Kolkata. My research focuses on quantum molecular dynamics, mathematical modelling, algorithmic developments, and high-performance computing simulations of complex molecular systems. _
